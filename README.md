# LaunchBox

LaunchBox is a business simulation game designed to educate and empower entrepreneurs. In this game, players learn the ins and outs of running various micro business types, along with an introduction to applied uses of blockchain technology for their business, guided by an AI Advisor.

Progress on TronDAO forum:

The app is currently structured into several key directories:

- `src/adapters`: This directory contains the adapters for integrating with external services like the OpenAI API.
- `src/components`: This directory contains the reusable React components used throughout the application.
- `src/pages`: This directory contains the page components that make up the different screens of the application.
